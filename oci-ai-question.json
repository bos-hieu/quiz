        ],
        "correct_answer": "Because text representation is categorical unlike images",
        "explanation": "Diffusion models work well with continuous data, where the process involves gradually adding noise to the data and then learning to reverse this process. In image generation, this works well because pixel values are inherently continuous. Text data, on the other hand, is discrete and categorical; words are symbols that come from a fixed vocabulary and they can't be meaningfully interpolated like pixel values. This discreteness means that you can't directly apply the same gradual noise and denoising process that works for images."
